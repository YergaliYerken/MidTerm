# Global Student Portal Dependency Graph in Neo4j

This project sets up a Neo4j database to analyze software dependencies and calculate stability metrics using Cypher queries.

## Setup

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**
   - Ensure you have Docker installed: [Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - Ensure you have Docker Compose installed.

2. **Run Neo4j**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This starts a Neo4j container accessible at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) with the credentials `neo4j/test123`.

3. **Load Dependency Graph**
   - Open Neo4j Browser and execute the Cypher script from `neo4j_stability_metrics.cypher` to create nodes and relationships.

4. **Run Stability Metric Queries**
   - The Cypher script includes queries to compute Fan-in, Fan-out, and Instability.
   - Results are formatted as a Markdown table.

## Queries
- **Create Components and Dependencies**
- **Compute Fan-in (incoming dependencies)**
- **Compute Fan-out (outgoing dependencies)**
- **Compute Instability (I = fan_out / (fan_in + fan_out))**

## Example Output
```
| Component | Fan-in | Fan-out | Instability |
|---|---|---|---|
| AuthService | 0 | 1 | 1.0 |
| UserService | 1 | 1 | 0.5 |
| PaymentService | 1 | 1 | 0.5 |
| NotificationService | 1 | 1 | 0.5 |
| ReportingService | 1 | 0 | 0.0 |
```
